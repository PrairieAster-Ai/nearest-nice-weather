3. **Enhanced Navigation**: Maximum 3 clicks to reach any documentation
4. **Search Functionality**: All content discoverable via wiki search
5. **Link Integrity**: All internal and external links functional post-migration

### **Quality Standards**
- All migrated content reviewed and updated for accuracy
- Consistent formatting and structure across all wiki pages
