# Claude Local Artifacts Directory

This directory contains local artifacts, logs, and temporary files generated by Claude Code sessions. These files are automatically excluded from git tracking to keep the repository clean.

## Directory Structure

- `logs/` - Development server logs, monitoring logs, and debug output
- `docs/` - Local documentation and analysis files specific to Claude sessions
- `scripts/` - Claude-specific utility scripts and debugging tools
- `tests/` - Debug test files and temporary test artifacts

## Purpose

This directory serves as a workspace for Claude to store:
- Session-specific analysis and debugging files
- Temporary logs and monitoring output
- Local configuration files not meant for the repository
- Development artifacts that don't need version control

## Git Ignore

All files in this directory are automatically ignored by git via the `.gitignore` entry:
```
# Claude local artifacts and scripts
.claude-local/
```

## Cleanup

Files in this directory can be safely deleted at any time as they are regenerated as needed during development sessions.
