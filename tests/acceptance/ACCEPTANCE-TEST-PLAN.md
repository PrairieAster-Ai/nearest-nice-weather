# Acceptance Test Plan - Production Readiness Validation

**Purpose**: Validate production-ready status through end-to-end acceptance testing
**Scope**: Critical user workflows, API integration, data integrity, performance
**Target Environments**: Localhost, Preview, Production

---

## Test Categories

### 1. API Acceptance Tests
**Objective**: Validate all API endpoints work correctly end-to-end

- ✅ Health check endpoint returns correct status
- ✅ POI discovery with weather integration
- ✅ Feedback submission with database persistence
- ✅ CORS headers configured correctly
- ✅ Error handling returns appropriate status codes
- ✅ Performance: Response times < 2 seconds

### 2. Frontend Acceptance Tests
**Objective**: Validate critical user workflows function correctly

- 📍 Map displays POI locations correctly
- 🌤️ Weather data appears for each POI
- 🔍 Search/filter functionality works
- 📝 Feedback form submission succeeds
- 📱 Responsive design on mobile/desktop
- ⚡ Performance: Page load < 3 seconds

### 3. Data Integrity Tests
**Objective**: Ensure data consistency across environments

- ✅ POI count meets minimum threshold (100+ locations)
- ✅ Weather data is real (not mock/fallback)
- ✅ Database connectivity confirmed
- ✅ Environment variables configured correctly

### 4. Integration Tests
**Objective**: Validate third-party integrations

- 🌐 OpenWeather API integration
- 🗄️ Neon database connectivity
- 🚀 Vercel deployment configuration
- 📊 Structured logging output

## Acceptance Criteria

### Critical (Must Pass)
- [ ] All API endpoints return 200 for valid requests
- [ ] POI data loads successfully in all environments
- [ ] Weather data is populated (not null/undefined)
- [ ] Feedback submission stores data in database
- [ ] No console errors in browser developer tools
- [ ] No 500 errors in production logs

### High Priority (Should Pass)
- [ ] Response times < 2 seconds (API)
- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds (Frontend)
- [ ] Weather data is accurate (OpenWeather API)
- [ ] CORS headers allow cross-origin requests
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

### Nice to Have (Can Defer)
- [ ] Offline functionality (PWA)
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 50%
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: API Acceptance Tests (Vitest)
```javascript
tests/acceptance/api/
  ├── health-check.acceptance.test.js
  ├── poi-discovery.acceptance.test.js
  ├── feedback-submission.acceptance.test.js
  └── performance.acceptance.test.js
```

### Phase 2: Frontend Acceptance Tests (Playwright)
```javascript
tests/acceptance/frontend/
  ├── map-display.acceptance.spec.ts
  ├── poi-interaction.acceptance.spec.ts
  ├── feedback-form.acceptance.spec.ts
  └── responsive-design.acceptance.spec.ts
```

### Phase 3: Environment Validation
- Run all tests against localhost
- Run all tests against preview (p.nearestniceweather.com)
- Run all tests against production (nearestniceweather.com)
- Generate test report with pass/fail by environment

---

## Success Metrics

**Production-Ready Definition**:
- ✅ 100% of critical tests pass in all environments
- ✅ 90%+ of high-priority tests pass
- ✅ Zero 500 errors during test execution
- ✅ All environments respond within SLA (< 2s API, < 3s page load)

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement API acceptance tests (Vitest)
2. Implement frontend acceptance tests (Playwright)
3. Run test suite across all environments
4. Generate production readiness report
