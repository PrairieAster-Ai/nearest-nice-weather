# Root Directory Organization Summary

## Overview
The project root directory has been cleaned up and organized into a logical structure that improves maintainability and discoverability.

## Directory Structure

### üìÅ scripts/
Organized development and utility scripts:
- **archived/** - Old startup scripts (dev-startup.sh, etc.)
- **database/** - Database migration and seeding scripts
- **deployment/** - Deployment and CI/CD scripts
- **development/** - Development tools (Claude intelligence, MCP servers)
- **testing/** - Test scripts and quality checks
- **utilities/** - Helper scripts (health checks, fixes, validation)

### üìÅ assets/
Project assets and data:
- **screenshots/** - All PNG screenshots from testing and documentation
- **data/** - JSON data files (POI data, weather data, migrations)
- **diagrams/** - (Reserved for future architectural diagrams)

### üìÅ documentation/
Organized documentation:
- **guides/** - How-to guides, standards, workflows
- **prd/** - Product requirement documents
- **reports/** - Analysis reports, summaries, evaluations
- **strategies/** - Strategy documents, plans, roadmaps
- **summaries/** - Project summaries, feature lists, specifications

### üìÅ archive/
Historical/deprecated files:
- **old-scripts/** - Deprecated JavaScript utilities
- **old-tests/** - Old test files and experiments
- **old-configs/** - (Reserved for deprecated configurations)
- **old-data/** - (Reserved for deprecated data files)

## Key Files Remaining in Root
Essential project files that should stay in root:
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude AI instructions
- `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` - Project charter
- `SESSION-HANDOFF.md` - Session continuity
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json` - Node.js configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker configuration
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment config
- `playwright.config.js` - Test configuration
- `dev-startup-optimized.sh` - Main startup script
- `dev-api-server.js` - Development API server

## Migration Notes
- All test-related JavaScript files moved to `scripts/testing/`
- All debug and inspection utilities moved to `scripts/utilities/`
- All screenshots consolidated in `assets/screenshots/`
- All data JSON files consolidated in `assets/data/`
- Documentation organized by type for easier navigation

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner root directory** - Only essential files remain
2. **Logical organization** - Files grouped by purpose
3. **Easier navigation** - Clear directory structure
4. **Better discoverability** - Related files together
5. **Simplified maintenance** - Know where to find/add files

## Usage Examples
```bash
# Run a test script
node scripts/testing/test-filter-performance.js

# Check database migration
node scripts/database/migration-check.js

# View deployment scripts
ls scripts/deployment/

# Find all screenshots
ls assets/screenshots/

# Browse documentation
ls documentation/reports/
```
