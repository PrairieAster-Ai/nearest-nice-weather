# [Story] Conditional CodeQL Analysis for Optimized Security Scanning

## User Story

As a **developer** I want **CodeQL security analysis to run only when security-relevant code changes** so that **I can reduce CI/CD time while maintaining appropriate security coverage**.

## Business Value
- **Potential 30% reduction in CI/CD time** for non-security changes
- **Reduced GitHub Actions compute costs** through selective scanning
- **Maintained security coverage** for relevant code paths
- **Faster feedback loop** for routine development tasks

## ⚠️ **RECOMMENDED STATUS: DO NOT IMPLEMENT**

Based on comprehensive analysis, this feature is **NOT RECOMMENDED** due to high security risks that outweigh performance benefits.

## Story Size

**8 story points** (High complexity - complex conditional logic + high security risk)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CodeQL runs on all security-relevant file changes
- [ ] CodeQL runs on scheduled basis (weekly minimum)
- [ ] CodeQL runs on manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)
- [ ] Complex path detection logic handles edge cases
- [ ] Zero false negatives (missing security scans)
- [ ] Clear documentation of when CodeQL will/won't run
- [ ] Team training on conditional scanning logic

## Technical Implementation Details

### Proposed Conditional Logic
```yaml
# Complex conditional logic required
if: |
  contains(join(github.event.commits.*.modified, ' '), 'security/') ||
  contains(join(github.event.commits.*.modified, ' '), '.github/') ||
  contains(join(github.event.commits.*.modified, ' '), 'auth') ||
  contains(join(github.event.commits.*.modified, ' '), 'login') ||
  contains(join(github.event.commits.*.modified, ' '), 'password') ||
  contains(join(github.event.commits.*.modified, ' '), 'token') ||
  github.event_name == 'schedule' ||
  github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' ||
  github.event.head_commit.message contains '[security]'
```

### Path Detection Challenges
- **File Path Complexity**: Security implications in unexpected files
- **Indirect Dependencies**: Library updates affecting security
- **Build Configuration**: Changes to build process affecting security
- **Documentation**: Security-related docs (runbooks, procedures)

## Effort Assessment: ⭐ HIGH (90 minutes)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Logic Design** (30 min): Define comprehensive path detection rules
2. **Implementation** (30 min): Add conditional logic to workflow
3. **Testing** (30 min): Validate multiple scenarios and edge cases

**Ongoing Maintenance:**
- **Rule Updates**: Continuous refinement as codebase evolves
- **False Negative Monitoring**: Regular review of missed scans
- **Team Training**: Educate team on when to force security scans

## Risk Assessment: 🟠 HIGH (CRITICAL SECURITY CONCERNS)

### Security Risks: 🚨 **CRITICAL**
- **False Negatives**: Missing security issues in "non-security" code
- **Indirect Vulnerabilities**: Security issues in unexpected file types
- **Logic Complexity**: Complex conditions = higher chance of bugs
- **Human Error**: Developers might not recognize security implications
- **Compliance Issues**: May violate security scanning requirements

### Technical Risks:
- **Maintenance Burden**: Rules need constant updates
- **Edge Case Failures**: Unexpected file paths bypass security
- **Git History Complexity**: Path detection across commits is error-prone

### Operational Risks:
- **Team Confusion**: When does security scanning happen?
- **Incident Response**: Delayed discovery of security issues
- **Audit Trail**: Explaining why security scans were skipped

## Benefits Analysis: ⚠️ **LIMITED VALUE**

### Performance Benefits:
- **Potential Time Savings**: 1m 29s CodeQL time (~30% of pipeline)
- **Cost Reduction**: Fewer GitHub Actions minutes
- **Faster Routine Changes**: Non-security commits get faster feedback

### **Why Benefits Don't Justify Risks:**
1. **CodeQL is Already Optimized**: 1m 29s is reasonable for comprehensive analysis
2. **Infrequent Execution**: Most teams don't have excessive CodeQL overhead
3. **Security vs Speed Tradeoff**: Security should not be compromised for speed
4. **Alternative Optimizations**: Parallelization achieves similar speed gains safely

## Alternative Recommendations

### ✅ **Safer Performance Optimizations:**
1. **Parallelize CodeQL**: Run alongside other jobs (45% time reduction)
2. **Optimize CodeQL Settings**: Focus on high-severity rules
3. **Scheduled Deep Scans**: Daily light scans + weekly comprehensive
4. **Infrastructure Upgrades**: Use faster GitHub Actions runners

### ✅ **Security-First Approach:**
```yaml
# Recommended: Always run CodeQL with optimizations
codeql-analysis:
  # Use parallel execution instead of conditional logic
  # Optimize query sets for speed vs comprehensive coverage balance
  # Cache analysis databases for incremental scanning
```

## Definition of Done (If Implemented Despite Recommendations)

- [ ] Comprehensive path detection rules implemented
- [ ] All security-relevant paths identified and tested
- [ ] Fallback to manual trigger always available
- [ ] Weekly scheduled CodeQL runs regardless of changes
- [ ] Team training on forcing security scans when needed
- [ ] Documentation of all conditional logic rules
- [ ] Security team approval of conditional logic
- [ ] Audit trail showing when/why scans were skipped
- [ ] Monitoring for false negatives
- [ ] Rollback plan if security issues are missed

## Security Review Requirements

### **🔍 Security Team Sign-off Required:**
- [ ] Security architect approval of conditional logic
- [ ] Compliance team review of scanning frequency
- [ ] Incident response plan for missed vulnerabilities
- [ ] Regular review schedule for rule effectiveness

### **🚨 Red Flags - Stop Implementation:**
- If any security team member objects
- If compliance requirements mandate full scanning
- If false negatives are detected in testing
- If maintenance burden exceeds team capacity

## Cross-References

- **Current CI/CD Workflow**: [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](https://github.com/PrairieAster-Ai/nearest-nice-weather/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- **Alternative Optimization**: [PHASE3-PARALLELIZE-SECURITY-JOBS.md](./PHASE3-PARALLELIZE-SECURITY-JOBS.md)
- **GitHub CodeQL Documentation**: [CodeQL Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action)

## **⚠️ FINAL RECOMMENDATION: REJECT THIS STORY**

**Rationale:**
1. **Security Risk Too High**: Potential for missing critical vulnerabilities
2. **Limited Performance Benefit**: 1m 29s savings not worth security compromise
3. **Better Alternatives Available**: Parallelization achieves similar gains safely
4. **High Maintenance Burden**: Complex logic requires ongoing maintenance

**Alternative Action:**
- **Implement Phase 3 (Parallelization)** instead for safe performance gains
- **Focus on CodeQL optimization** rather than conditional execution
- **Consider this feature only if security team specifically requests it**
