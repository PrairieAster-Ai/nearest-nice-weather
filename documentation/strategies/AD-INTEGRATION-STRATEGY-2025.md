**Ad Design Requirements**:
- **Clearly marked**: Distinct visual treatment to identify as advertisement
- **Contextually integrated**: Matches popup design language
- **Action-oriented**: Clear call-to-action relevant to user journey

**Activity-Based Advertising**:
- **Pre-trip planning**: Gear suggestions before leaving home

  return prioritizeAds([
    ...destinationBusinesses.filter(activityBusinesses),
    ...routeBusinesses.filter(relevantToTrip),
  ]);
}
```

```javascript
const activityAdMapping = {
  hiking: ["outdoor_gear", "food_beverage", "photography"],
  biking: ["bike_shops", "sports_gear", "repair_services"],
  photography: ["camera_gear", "photo_services", "scenic_restaurants"],
  picnicking: ["grocery_stores", "food_beverage", "outdoor_gear"],
  water_activities: ["swimwear", "water_gear", "waterfront_dining"]
};
```

**Weather-Based Targeting**:
```javascript
const weatherAdMapping = {
  hot_weather: ["cooling_gear", "hydration", "shade_accessories"],
  cold_weather: ["warm_clothing", "hot_beverages", "heating_accessories"],
  rainy_weather: ["rain_gear", "indoor_alternatives", "weather_protection"],
