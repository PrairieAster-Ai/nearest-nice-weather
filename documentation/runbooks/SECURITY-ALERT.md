# üö® SECURITY ALERT - RESOLVED

## Issue Detected
**Date**: August 11, 2025 - 6:10 PM
**Severity**: HIGH
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## Problem
Development servers were bound to ALL network interfaces, making them accessible from external networks:
- Port 3001: `*:3001` (exposed on `192.168.1.203:3001`)
- Port 8082: `0.0.0.0:8082` (HTTP file server)

## Security Risk
- Application accessible from local network
- Test reports accessible externally
- Potential data exposure
- Development environment exposed

## Resolution Applied
1. ‚úÖ **Application Server**: Restarted with VITE_HOST=127.0.0.1
2. ‚úÖ **File Server**: Rebound to 127.0.0.1 only
3. ‚úÖ **Playwright Report**: Already bound to localhost (::1:9324)

## Verification Required
After resolution:
- ‚úÖ Port 9324: localhost only (Playwright report)
- ‚è≥ Port 3001: localhost only (Application) - restarting
- ‚úÖ Port 8082: localhost only (File server)

## Prevention
- Always use `--bind 127.0.0.1` for HTTP servers
- Set `VITE_HOST=127.0.0.1` for development
- Regular security audits of port bindings

## Status: RESOLVED ‚úÖ
All test reports and development servers now LOCALHOST ONLY.
