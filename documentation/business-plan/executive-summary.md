## 💡 Business Concept

### The Problem
- **"Where can I get tacos when it's nice out?"** - Core value avoiding feature creep
- People have different weather preferences: some prefer cold, others warm; some like rain, others avoid it
- Weather apps only show local conditions, don't suggest better budget-friendly locations nearby
- No simple tool exists to find preferred weather conditions within driving distance for free/cheap activities

### The Solution
**Ultra-Simple Weather Filter Progressive Web App**:

```
Your Location + Weather Preferences → Nearest Matching Weather → User Data + Premium Features
```

**MVP Features (Free-Only Launch)** - Risk-Aware Development: 
- **Simple Filters**: Radio buttons for Temperature, Precipitation, Wind preferences - biological UX optimization
- **Unlimited Saves**: Create account to save unlimited custom filter combinations ("Perfect Free Day", "Budget Adventure Weather")
- **Time-Based Voting**: Monthly 48-hour voting rounds on next features to build (creates urgency and engagement)
- **Ad-Supported**: Free tier with competitor-neutral ad networks, premium features determined post-launch
- **Risk Mitigation**: Each sprint validates core value before adding complexity

**Post-MVP Features** (Based on User Voting):
- **Email Newsletter**: Weekly weather updates based on saved filter preferences
- **Premium Features**: Interactive maps, historical trends, custom algorithms (user-determined priorities)

### Competitive Advantage
1. **Ultra-Simple Interface**: Just 3 radio button filters - anyone can use immediately
2. **User-Driven Development**: Feature voting system ensures building what users actually want
3. **Filter Usage Analytics**: Identify premium feature demand through actual user behavior patterns
4. **Freemium Conversion**: Free users become premium based on demonstrated value, not assumptions
5. **Progressive Web App**: No app store barriers, instant access, works offline
