# Capability: Team Scaling Infrastructure (10-15 Technical Professionals)

## Overview
**Capability ID**: TEAM-SCALE-INFRA
**Type**: Technical Infrastructure Capability
**Priority**: High (Critical for team growth)
**Status**: Planning Phase

## Business Context
**Objective**: Enable rapid onboarding and productivity for 10-15 technical professionals with automated systems that provide easy access to all information needed for successful project contribution.

**Value Proposition**:
- Reduce onboarding time from 2-3 days to 2-4 hours per developer
- Enable parallel development without conflicts or production breaks
- Create self-documenting systems that eliminate knowledge silos
- Establish automated quality gates for consistent code standards

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
**GitHub Workflows Re-enablement:**
- Configure essential secrets (VERCEL_TOKEN, NEON_API_KEY, PROJECT_TOKEN)
- Enable basic CI workflow with build validation
- Standardize development environment setup
- Document architecture and deployment processes

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `.github/workflows/team-safety.yml` - Basic build and type checking
- [ ] `TEAM-ONBOARDING.md` - Complete setup documentation
- [ ] `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Standardized development environment
- [ ] GitHub secrets configuration guide

### Phase 2: Safety & Quality (Weeks 3-4)
**Automated Quality Gates:**
- Implement comprehensive testing pipeline
- Add performance regression detection
- Create PR review automation
- Establish bundle size monitoring

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` - Automated testing
- [ ] Performance budget enforcement
- [ ] Automated security scanning
- [ ] Code review assignment automation

### Phase 3: Team Productivity (Weeks 5-6)
**Knowledge Management:**
- Auto-generated API documentation
- Component storybook for UI elements
- Database schema documentation
- Real-time system monitoring

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Automated documentation generation
- [ ] Development environment automation scripts
- [ ] Team communication integrations (Slack/Discord)
- [ ] Knowledge base with search functionality

## Success Metrics

### Developer Experience
- **Onboarding Time**: < 4 hours from repo access to first contribution
- **Environment Setup**: Automated, zero manual configuration
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of critical systems documented
- **Development Velocity**: No reduction with team size increase

### Code Quality & Safety
- **Production Breaks**: Zero breaks from new team members
- **Code Review**: 100% automated assignment and validation
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained above 80% with automated enforcement
- **Performance**: No regression in bundle size or load times

### Team Coordination
- **Merge Conflicts**: Reduced by 90% through automated conflict detection
- **Deployment Safety**: 100% of deployments through automated pipeline
- **Knowledge Sharing**: All team members can deploy and troubleshoot
- **Communication**: Automated notifications for all system changes

## Story Points Breakdown
**Total Estimate**: 34 Story Points

- Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure): 13 points
- Phase 2 (Safety & Quality): 13 points
- Phase 3 (Team Productivity): 8 points

## Priority Justification
**High Priority** - Critical infrastructure for team scaling. Without this capability:
- New developers take 2-3 days to become productive
- Risk of production breaks increases exponentially with team size
- Knowledge silos create single points of failure
- Manual processes become bottlenecks for 10+ person team

## Dependencies
- GitHub repository access and admin permissions
- Vercel account with team access
- Neon database with API access
- Team communication platform (Slack/Discord)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Technical**: Start with minimal viable automation, expand incrementally
- **Team**: Automated onboarding reduces dependency on senior developers
- **Quality**: Automated gates prevent inconsistency across team members
