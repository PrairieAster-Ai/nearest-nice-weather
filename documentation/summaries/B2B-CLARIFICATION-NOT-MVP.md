## üéØ Current Business Model (What's Actually Built)

### **100% B2C Focus**
- **Target Users**: Individual outdoor enthusiasts in Minnesota
- **Revenue Model**: Ad-supported free platform
- **Features**: POI discovery with weather enhancement

### **Technical Implementation**
- Frontend focused on individual users
- APIs serve consumer-facing data only
- No business dashboards or analytics
- No operator accounts or B2B auth
- No marketplace functionality

## üìã For Claude Code Context

### **When Building Features**
‚úÖ **BUILD**: Features for individual outdoor enthusiasts
‚ùå **DON'T BUILD**: Tourism operator dashboards or B2B features

### **When Reading Documentation**
‚úÖ **TRUST**: Technical implementation files (actual code)
‚ö†Ô∏è **QUESTION**: Business plan B2B references (future speculation)

### **Business Model Reminder**
```
Current Reality: B2C outdoor recreation discovery

MVP Focus: Individual users finding parks with nice weather
```

## üöÄ Development Priorities

1. **Enhance B2C Experience**: Better POI discovery, filtering, weather accuracy
2. **Grow User Base**: Focus on 10,000+ active users target
3. **Improve Performance**: Faster load times, better mobile experience
4. **Add User Features**: Saved searches, preferences (still B2C)
5. **NO B2B FEATURES**: Don't build any tourism operator functionality
