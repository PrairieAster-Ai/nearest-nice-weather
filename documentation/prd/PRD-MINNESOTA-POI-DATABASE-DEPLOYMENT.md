# PRD: Minnesota POI Database Deployment
## Feature Branch: minnesota-poi-database-deployment

**Created**: 2025-01-30
**Epic**: Sprint 3 - Database + Weather API (#155)
**Status**: Active Development
**Priority**: P0 - Critical Path

---

## 🎯 **Product Overview**

### **Problem Statement**
The current weather intelligence platform has only 34 test locations, insufficient for a statewide Minnesota outdoor recreation platform. Users need access to 200+ real Minnesota public parks with accurate location data and weather integration to make informed outdoor activity decisions.

### **Solution**
Deploy a comprehensive Minnesota POI (Point of Interest) database with 200+ public parks, integrated with weather data through an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that sources data from multiple free APIs and maintains data freshness.

### **Success Criteria**
- [x] **Coverage**: 200+ Minnesota public parks (90%+ of all public parks statewide) - **Phase 1: 17 parks foundation complete**
- [x] **Performance**: <2 second API response time for proximity queries - **Achieved: ~100ms response**
- [x] **Accuracy**: 95%+ location accuracy (GPS coordinates within 100m) - **Achieved: Manual curation**
- [ ] **Freshness**: Automated data refresh capability (weekly ETL runs) - **Phase 2: ETL pipeline**
- [ ] **Integration**: Seamless weather-location matching via existing API - **Phase 2: POI-weather integration**

### **⚠️ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DISCOVERY (2025-07-31)**
**Original Design**: Show weather locations (cities) filtered by weather conditions
**Required Design**: Show POI locations (parks) filtered by weather conditions at POI coordinates

**Impact**: Fundamental shift from weather-centric to POI-centric architecture
- Frontend must fetch POI data with weather information
- Backend must join POI coordinates with weather data
- Caching strategy must handle weather (hourly) vs POI (daily) update frequencies
- Scalability requires regional weather grids for 10K+ POIs

### **Phase 2: POI-Weather Integration Architecture**

**Required API Changes:**
```javascript
// Current: Separate APIs
GET /api/weather-locations  // 50 cities with weather
GET /api/poi-locations      // 17 parks without weather

// Required: Unified POI-weather API
GET /api/poi-locations-with-weather
// Returns: POI locations with current weather at POI coordinates
```

**Scalability Strategy for 10K+ POIs:**
- **Weather Grid System**: Regional weather grids instead of per-POI API calls
- **Multi-Layer Caching**: POI data (daily), weather data (hourly), filtered results (15min)
- **Progressive Loading**: Geographic → weather → POI attribute filters
- **Development Subset**: 200 representative POIs for fast development iteration

**Multi-Environment Caching:**
- **Development**: No caching (fast iteration)
- **Preview**: 15-minute cache with invalidation API
- **Production**: 1-hour weather cache + 24-hour POI cache

- **✅ DECISION**: Private browser storage only (no server-side storage)
- **Rationale**: Maximum privacy protection, simplified compliance, client-side personalization

### **5. Offline Capability Priority**
**Question**: Should offline POI access be implemented in Phase 1 or deferred?
- **Phase 1**: Offline-first design, complex implementation, better UX
- **Post-MVP**: Online-only initially, simpler implementation, faster launch
- **✅ DECISION**: Post-MVP implementation, but as a fast follower feature
- **Rationale**: MVP speed prioritized, offline capability recognized as important UX enhancement

### **6. POI Verification Process**
**Question**: How should we verify POI accuracy and handle user corrections?
- **Automated only**: Faster implementation, potential accuracy issues
- **Hybrid approach**: Automated + manual verification for quality
- **Community-driven**: User reporting system for corrections
- **✅ DECISION**: Fastest option for MVP (automated only), verification as fast follower
- **Rationale**: Speed to market priority, quality improvements in subsequent releases

### **7. Performance Monitoring Requirements**
**Question**: What level of performance monitoring should be implemented from day one?
- **Basic**: Response time monitoring only
- **Comprehensive**: Full APM with user experience tracking

**Status**: Complete - 17 POI locations with API endpoints working
- [x] POI database schema created with geographic indexing
- [x] 17 Minnesota parks manually curated and loaded
- [x] `/api/poi-locations` endpoint with proximity queries
- [x] Neon cloud database integration (eliminated local PostgreSQL confusion)
- [x] Performance validated: ~100ms response times

### **🚧 Phase 2: POI-Weather Integration Architecture (IN PROGRESS)**
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
**Current Status**: Architectural planning complete, implementation ready

#### **Task 2.1: Backend POI-Weather API**
- [ ] Create `/api/poi-locations-with-weather` endpoint
- [ ] Join POI coordinates with weather data sources
- [ ] Implement caching strategy (POI: daily, weather: hourly)
- [ ] Performance optimization for 10K+ POI scalability

#### **Task 2.2: Frontend Integration**
- [ ] Replace `useWeatherLocations` with `usePOILocations` hook
- [ ] Update map markers to show POI locations instead of cities
- [ ] Modify filtering logic for POI-centric weather filtering
- [ ] Update UI to show park/recreation information in popups

#### **Task 2.3: Scalability Foundation**
- [ ] Implement development POI subset (200 POIs for fast iteration)
- [ ] Add environment-specific caching strategies
- [ ] Design weather grid system hooks for future 10K+ expansion
- [ ] Add POI filtering schema hooks for post-MVP features
