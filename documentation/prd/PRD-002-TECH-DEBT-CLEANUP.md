# PRD - Tech Debt Cleanup & Developer Experience Enhancement

**PRD ID**: PRD-2025-07-15-002
**Created**: 2025-07-15
**Owner**: Bob Speer
**Status**: Active

## **Problem Statement**
Three critical developer experience issues are hampering productivity: 1) BrowserToolsMCP server-side functionality is missing, preventing automated console log capture and screenshot generation across environments, 2) Vercel preview authentication blocks Claude Code from inspecting preview deployments, and 3) Automated testing and CI/CD pipeline needs review and implementation for deployment safety.

## **Success Criteria** (Measurable)
- [ ] BrowserToolsMCP server operational on localhost:3025 across all environments
- [ ] Claude Code can automatically capture screenshots and console logs from localhost, preview, and production
- [ ] Claude Code can inspect Vercel preview environment without manual authentication
- [ ] Automated CI/CD pipeline running with quality gates
- [ ] 50% faster debugging through automated browser tool integration

## **Scope Definition**
### **In Scope**
- **Task 1**: BrowserToolsMCP server-side restoration with multi-environment support
- **Task 2**: Vercel preview authentication for Claude Code inspection
- **Task 3**: Automated testing and CI/CD pipeline review and implementation
- Integration with existing development workflow (npm start)
- Screenshot location standardization to `/home/robertspeer/Projects/screenshots`

### **Out of Scope** (Prevents Scope Creep)
- Major architectural changes to existing codebase
- New testing frameworks beyond existing Vitest/Playwright setup
- Browser extension modifications beyond server integration
- Performance optimizations beyond CI/CD pipeline
- Security audits beyond authentication implementation

## **Technical Requirements**
### **Task 1: BrowserToolsMCP Server**
- **Environments**: localhost, p.nearestniceweather.com, nearestniceweather.com
- **Port**: localhost:3025
- **Screenshot Location**: `/home/robertspeer/Projects/screenshots`
- **Console Log Scope**: All three environments
- **Integration**: Auto-start with npm start

### **Task 2: Vercel Preview Auth**
- **Target**: p.nearestniceweather.com automated access
- **Method**: Secure token management
- **Scope**: Claude Code MCP integration only

### **Task 3: CI/CD Pipeline**
- **Framework**: GitHub Actions
- **Quality Gates**: lint, type-check, tests
- **Test Types**: Unit (Vitest) + E2E (Playwright)
- **Deployment Blocking**: Test failures prevent production deployment

## **Acceptance Criteria** (Detailed)
### **Task 1: BrowserToolsMCP Server**
- [x] Server running on localhost:3025
- [x] Chrome extension connects to localhost, preview, and production
- [x] Console logs captured from all three environments
- [x] Screenshots saved to `/home/robertspeer/Projects/screenshots`
- [x] Claude Code can request screenshots via MCP from any environment
- [x] Real-time browser activity monitoring across environments
- [x] Auto-start with development environment

### **Task 2: Vercel Preview Auth**
- [ ] Claude Code can inspect p.nearestniceweather.com without manual auth
- [ ] Secure token management (no exposed secrets)
- [ ] Preview environment accessible via MCP tools
- [ ] Automatic token refresh if needed

### **Task 3: CI/CD Pipeline**
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow running on PR/push
- [x] Automated test execution (stable backend tests)
- [x] Quality gates (build verification, environment validation)
- [x] Deployment blocking on test failures
- [x] Clear CI/CD status reporting

## **Known Good State**
### **Baseline Information**
- **Git Tag**: v1.1-leaflet-fix-working
- **Git Commit**: 1dc4dc7d4e244dbaf65ebf3071ebdb094cefc1b2
- **Validation Date**: 2025-07-15 18:55 UTC
- **Validation Method**: Production deployment confirmed working

### **Current State Assessment**
- **What's Working**: Production site fully functional, preview environment operational
- **What's Missing**: BrowserToolsMCP server, automated preview access, CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependencies**: Chrome extension exists, MCP framework partially implemented

## **Rollback Procedures**
### **Rollback Triggers**
- BrowserToolsMCP server conflicts with existing development workflow
- Vercel authentication changes break existing deployments
- CI/CD pipeline blocks legitimate deployments
- Any task breaks existing production functionality

### **Rollback Steps**
1. `git checkout v1.1-leaflet-fix-working`
2. Verify production functionality: test nearestniceweather.com
3. Test development environment: `npm start`
4. If confirmed working, deploy to preview first
5. If preview works, deploy to production

### **Rollback Validation**
- [ ] Production site loads correctly (nearestniceweather.com)
- [ ] Preview environment accessible (p.nearestniceweather.com)
- [ ] Development environment starts without errors
- [ ] No new processes blocking development workflow

## **Context Preservation**
### **Background Information**
BrowserToolsMCP was previously working but lost server-side functionality. The Chrome extension infrastructure exists but needs server reconnection. Vercel preview authentication currently requires manual intervention for Claude Code inspections. CI/CD pipeline is needed for deployment safety as the project matures.

### **Related Work**
- **Dependencies**: Must not break existing v1.1-leaflet-fix-working functionality
- **Blockers**: None identified, all tasks are additive
- **Assumptions**: Chrome extension is functional, MCP protocol is stable

## **KPI Tracking** (Integrated Measurement)
### **Task 1 KPIs**
- **Development Speed**: 50% faster debugging (no manual screenshot sharing)
- **Context Preservation**: Real-time browser state visibility
- **Error Detection**: Automated console log capture
- **Multi-environment Support**: localhost + preview + production coverage

### **Task 2 KPIs**
- **Deployment Verification**: 100% automated preview validation
- **Testing Speed**: 75% faster preview testing
- **Security**: No manual credential sharing

### **Task 3 KPIs**
