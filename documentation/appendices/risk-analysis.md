### 4. Regulatory & Legal Risks

#### **Medium Impact - Low Probability**

**Weather Data Licensing Restrictions**
- **Risk**: New regulations on weather data redistribution
- **Impact**: Business model changes, compliance costs
- **Probability**: 20% based on current regulatory trends
- **Mitigation**:
  - Legal review of all data licensing agreements
  - Develop relationships with NOAA for public data access
  - Focus on analysis/insights rather than raw data redistribution
- **Monitoring**: Weather industry regulatory changes

**Privacy Regulation Changes**
- **Risk**: GDPR-style location privacy laws in Minnesota/US
- **Impact**: Technical reengineering, compliance costs
- **Probability**: 35% within 3 years
- **Mitigation**:
  - Privacy-by-design architecture
  - Minimal location data retention policies
  - User consent management system
- **Monitoring**: State and federal privacy legislation tracking

### 5. Financial Risks

#### **High Impact - Medium Probability**

**Funding Gap Before Profitability**
- **Risk**: Cash runway insufficient to reach break-even
