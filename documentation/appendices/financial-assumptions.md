```

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculation**:
```
Retention Analysis (SaaS Industry Data):

- Year 2 revenue: $3,600 × 0.80 = $2,880
- Year 3 revenue: $3,600 × 0.75 = $2,700
- Year 4 revenue: $3,600 × 0.75 = $2,700
- Year 5 revenue: $3,600 × 0.75 = $2,700

**Conservative LTV: $18,000** (5-year customer)
**LTV/CAC Ratio: 36:1** (vs. 15:1 industry standard)
```

### B2C Consumer Subscription Model

```

**Annual Contract Value**:
```
Pricing Strategy:
- Monthly subscription: $15/month
- Seasonal subscription (6 months): $50
- Annual subscription: $100 (savings incentive)

Usage Patterns:
- 60% seasonal users: $50 average
- 40% annual users: $100 average
- Weighted average: ($50 × 0.6) + ($100 × 0.4) = $70

**Conservative ACV: $60** (below weighted average)
```

**Lifetime Value**:
```
Retention Patterns:
- Consumer apps average 2-3 year retention
- Seasonal usage creates higher retention for outdoor recreation

Conservative Assumption:
- Average customer lifetime: 3 years
- Annual churn rate: 33%
