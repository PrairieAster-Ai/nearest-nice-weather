# MVP Plan vs MVP WBS - Critical Alignment Analysis

**Analysis Date**: July 26, 2025 (Original Analysis)
**Updated**: July 29, 2025 (GitHub Project Migration)
**Purpose**: Validate 100% alignment between MVP Plan presentation and MVP WBS presentation
**Status**: üìö **HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY**

## üö® IMPORTANT UPDATE - JULY 29, 2025

**SUPERSEDED**: This analysis compared historical presentations. Both presentations have been superseded by the GitHub Project "NearestNiceWeather.com App Development" as the single source of truth for current work planning.

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ All MVP work items migrated to GitHub Project with proper hierarchy
- ‚úÖ Sprint structure maintained in GitHub Project (Database + Weather API, Revenue + Launch)
- ‚úÖ Story points and estimates preserved in GitHub Project issues
- ‚úÖ Live tracking replaces static presentation alignment

**For Current Work**: Reference https://github.com/orgs/PrairieAster-Ai/projects/2 instead of analyzing presentation misalignments.

1. **üö® RESOLVE SPRINT NUMBERING**
   - Choose consistent numbering scheme (0-4 or 1-4)
   - Align sprint names across both presentations
   - Ensure sprint status consistency

2. **üö® RECONCILE SPRINT CONTENT**
   - Map MVP Plan deliverables to WBS epics/user stories
   - Ensure completed work matches between presentations
   - Identify missing deliverables in each presentation

3. **üö® ALIGN TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**
   - Clarify FastAPI vs Vercel API Functions
   - Reconcile PostGIS vs PostgreSQL references
   - Ensure file references are accurate

## üîç NEXT STEPS FOR ALIGNMENT

1. **Choose Master Source**: Decide which presentation is authoritative
2. **Sprint Reconciliation**: Create unified sprint structure
3. **Technical Stack Clarification**: Document actual vs. planned architecture
4. **File Validation**: Verify all references against codebase
5. **Status Update**: Ensure current progress is accurately reflected
6. **Content Synchronization**: Update both presentations for consistency

**ORIGINAL RECOMMENDATION**: Use MVP WBS as master source for implementation details and align MVP Plan business content accordingly.

**CURRENT RECOMMENDATION (July 29, 2025)**: Use GitHub Project "NearestNiceWeather.com App Development" as the single source of truth for all current work planning. Historical presentations serve as reference context only.
