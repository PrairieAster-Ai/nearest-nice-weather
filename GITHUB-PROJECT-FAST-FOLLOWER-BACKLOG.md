### **Story: Multi-Source Weather API Aggregation**
**Epic**: Weather Intelligence & Reliability  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days  

**Description**: Implement redundant weather data sources with intelligent fallback and aggregation for improved reliability and accuracy.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Integration with 2-3 additional weather APIs (Weather API, NOAA, Visual Crossing)
- [ ] Intelligent source selection based on reliability and accuracy
- [ ] Automatic failover when primary weather source unavailable
- [ ] Weather data aggregation and consensus algorithms
- [ ] API cost monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Historical weather accuracy tracking by source

**Business Value**: Improved weather data reliability, reduced single-point-of-failure risk

### **Story: Feature Flag System for Database Rollback**
**Epic**: Infrastructure & Risk Management  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days  

**Description**: Implement feature flag system enabling quick rollback to 34-location dataset if issues arise with 200+ POI deployment.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Environment variable-based feature flag system
- [ ] Instant toggle between old (34 locations) and new (200+ POIs) datasets
- [ ] API endpoint compatibility maintained across both datasets
- [ ] Admin interface for feature flag management
- [ ] Automated monitoring for rollback trigger conditions
- [ ] Zero-downtime dataset switching capability

**Business Value**: Risk mitigation, deployment confidence, rapid issue resolution
