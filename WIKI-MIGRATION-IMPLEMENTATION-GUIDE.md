## 🔧 Tools and Automation

### **Link Conversion Script**
```python
import re
import os

def convert_md_links_to_wiki(content):
    """Convert markdown file links to wiki page links"""
    
    # Pattern for relative markdown links
    pattern = r'\]\(\.?\.?/([^)]+)\.md\)'
    
    def replace_link(match):
        path = match.group(1)
        # Convert file path to wiki page name
        page_name = path.split('/')[-1].replace('-', ' ').title().replace(' ', '-')
        return f']({page_name})'
    
    return re.sub(pattern, replace_link, content)

# Usage example
with open('original_file.md', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

wiki_content = convert_md_links_to_wiki(content)

with open('wiki_ready_file.md', 'w') as f:
    f.write(wiki_content)
```

### **Content Validation Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Validate wiki content before migration

echo "Validating content for wiki migration..."

# Check for broken internal links
echo "Checking for potential broken links..."
grep -r "]\(\./" wiki-content-prepared/ || echo "No relative links found - Good!"

# Check for outdated dates
echo "Checking for outdated references..."
grep -r "2024" wiki-content-prepared/ | head -10

# Check for status indicators needing updates
echo "Checking status indicators..."
grep -r "Status:" wiki-content-prepared/ | head -10

echo "Validation complete. Review flagged items before migration."
```

## 📊 Success Validation

### **Post-Migration Testing**
1. **Navigation Testing**: Validate 3-click rule for all content
2. **Search Testing**: Verify findability of key information
3. **Team Access**: Confirm all team members can edit and contribute
4. **Link Integrity**: Test all internal and external links
5. **Mobile Access**: Validate wiki functionality on mobile devices

### **Business Impact Measurement**
- **Documentation Update Frequency**: Measure before/after migration
- **Team Satisfaction**: Survey team on ease of use and accessibility
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Track business stakeholder participation
- **Information Discovery Time**: Measure time to find specific information

## 🎯 Next Steps for Implementation
