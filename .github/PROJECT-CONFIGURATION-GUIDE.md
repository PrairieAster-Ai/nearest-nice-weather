## 📊 **GitHub Project Views Recommended:**

### **1. Sprint Board View**
```
Columns: Backlog | Sprint Planning | In Progress | Review | Done
Filter: Current sprint milestone
Group by: Issue type (Epic > Story > Task)
```

### **2. Roadmap Timeline View**
```
Timeline: Milestone due dates
Group by: Sprint (Milestone)
Show: Parent-child relationships
Color by: Priority level
```

### **3. Capability Matrix View**
```
Rows: Capabilities (#5, #13, #14)
Columns: Status (Planning/Development/Done)
Show: Child epic progress
Filter: MVP phase only
```

### **4. Priority Triage View**
```
Sort by: Priority (High → Low)
Filter: Status = Ready for Development
Group by: Sprint milestone  
Show: Business impact level
```

## 🎯 **Workflow Optimization:**

### **Daily Standup View:**
- Filter: Current sprint + In Progress status
- Group by: Assignee
- Show: Blockers and dependencies

### **Sprint Planning View:**
- Filter: Next sprint milestone + Ready status
- Sort by: Priority and dependencies
- Show: Effort estimates and complexity

### **Backlog Grooming View:**
- Filter: No milestone assigned + MVP phase
- Sort by: Business impact
- Show: Effort vs. value analysis

## 🚀 **Advanced Project Automations:**

### **Status Automation Rules:**
1. **Epic Complete**: When all child stories are closed → Set epic to Done
2. **Sprint Ready**: When all dependencies resolved → Move to Ready column
3. **Blocked Detection**: When dependency issues found → Add blocked label
4. **Priority Escalation**: When high-priority blocked > 3 days → Notify team

### **Milestone Integration:**
- Sprint milestones automatically update project timeline
- Epic completion triggers capability progress updates
- Task completion rolls up to story and epic progress
- Post-MVP items remain in separate backlog view

## 📈 **Project Health Metrics:**

### **Sprint Velocity Tracking:**
- Story points completed per sprint
- Epic burn-down charts
- Velocity trend analysis
- Predictive completion dates

### **Dependency Risk Monitoring:**
- Critical path identification
- Blocked issue duration tracking
- Cross-team dependency alerts
- Risk mitigation suggestions

## 🔄 **Maintenance Commands:**

### **Keep Project Synchronized:**
```bash
# Refresh all issue configurations
npm run project:configure

# Generate current project report
npm run project:report

# Update specific issue types
node .github/scripts/project-configurator.js configure

# Monitor project health
npm run gh:milestones
```

## 🎉 **Result:**

Your GitHub Project is now optimized for:
- ✅ **Clear hierarchy visualization** (Sprint → Capability → Epic → Story → Task)
- ✅ **Automated progress tracking** with parent-child relationships
- ✅ **Business-focused prioritization** with revenue impact context
- ✅ **Timeline management** through milestone integration
- ✅ **Risk monitoring** with dependency and blocker detection
