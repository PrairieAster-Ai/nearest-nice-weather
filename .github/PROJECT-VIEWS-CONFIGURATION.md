# GitHub Project Views Configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Sprint Focus View

### Purpose
Eliminate cognitive overhead by showing only actionable current work, hiding completed and future sprint items to maximize development velocity.

### Configuration

**View Name**: `ðŸŽ¯ Current Sprint Focus`

**Filter Configuration:**
```yaml
# Hide completed work
- field: "Status"
  operator: "is not"
  value: "Done"

- field: "Status"
  operator: "is not"
  value: "Completed"

# Show only current sprint work
- field: "Sprint"
  operator: "is"
  value: "Revenue + Launch"

# Active team members only
- field: "Assignee"
  operator: "is any of"
  values: ["rhspeer", "active-team-members"]
```

**Grouping:**
- Primary: Status (In Progress â†’ Ready â†’ Blocked)
- Secondary: Priority (High â†’ Medium â†’ Low)

**Sorting:**
- Status (In Progress first)
- Priority (High priority first)
- Effort Estimate (Quick wins first)

**Layout:**
- Board view with compact cards
- Essential metadata only: Title, Assignee, Priority, Effort
- Hidden fields: Full description, creation date, detailed labels

### Expected Impact

**Before (Current View):**
- Decision Time: 15-30 seconds to identify next work item
- Cognitive Load: High (processing completed + future + current work)
- Daily Overhead: 5-10 minutes filtering relevant work

**After (Sprint Focus View):**
- Decision Time: 3-5 seconds to identify next work item
- Cognitive Load: Low (only actionable current work)
- Daily Overhead: 30 seconds maximum

**Business Value:**
- 15-20% development velocity improvement
- 90% reduction in decision overhead
- Higher sprint completion rates

## ðŸ“‹ Additional Recommended Views

### ðŸš« Blocked Items View
**Purpose**: Track and resolve workflow bottlenecks
**Filter**: Status = "Blocked" OR Blocked Reason â‰  "Not blocked"

### ðŸ”§ Technical Debt View
**Purpose**: Separate code quality work from feature development
**Filter**: Labels contains "technical-debt" OR "refactoring"

### ðŸ“Š Sprint Retrospective View
**Purpose**: Analyze completed work for sprint reviews
**Filter**: Status = "Done" AND Sprint = "Current Sprint"
**Grouping**: By Epic, showing completion metrics

## Implementation Instructions

1. **Access Project Settings**: https://github.com/orgs/PrairieAster-Ai/projects/2/settings
2. **Create New View**: Click "New view" â†’ "Board view"
3. **Apply Filters**: Use configuration above
4. **Set Grouping**: Configure primary/secondary grouping
5. **Optimize Layout**: Hide unnecessary fields, enable compact cards
6. **Test View**: Verify only current actionable work appears

## Success Metrics

Track these KPIs after implementation:
- Time to identify next work item (target: <5 seconds)
- Daily workflow overhead (target: <1 minute)
- Sprint completion rate improvement
- Developer satisfaction with project board usability
