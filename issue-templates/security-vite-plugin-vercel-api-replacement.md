**Labels**: `type: epic`, `backend`, `enhancement`, `urgent`
**Project**: NearestNiceWeather App Development
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 8-16 hours
**ROI**: Poor (high effort, moderate security benefit)

## Problem Statement
Current vite-plugin-vercel-api@0.4.0 has 6 security vulnerabilities (1 low, 3 moderate, 2 high) and hasn't been updated since November 2022, indicating potential abandonment.

## Current State
- **Package**: vite-plugin-vercel-api@0.4.0
- **Last Updated**: November 2022
- **Vulnerabilities**: 6 total (1 low, 3 moderate, 2 high)
  - cookie vulnerability
  - esbuild vulnerability
  - path-to-regexp vulnerability
  - undici vulnerability
- **Risk Level**: All vulnerabilities are in development dependencies, no production runtime exposure

## Proposed Solution
Research and implement modern alternatives:
- @vercel/vite-plugin-api
- Native Vercel integration approaches
- Other maintained Vite + Vercel integration packages

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research modern alternatives to vite-plugin-vercel-api
- [ ] Test replacement without breaking API development workflow
- [ ] Eliminate the 6 identified security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing Vercel deployment pipeline
- [ ] Validate localhost development environment still works
- [ ] Ensure production deployment process remains intact

## Effort Estimate
8-16 hours (cross-sprint effort due to complexity)

## Priority Justification
High priority due to multiple security vulnerabilities, but all are in development dependencies which reduces production risk.

## ROI Assessment
Poor - High effort with moderate security benefit since vulnerabilities are development-only
