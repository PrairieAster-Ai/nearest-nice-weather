# Security: npm audit vulnerability remediation strategy

**Labels**: `type: story`, `backend`, `enhancement`
**Project**: NearestNiceWeather App Development
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 2-4 hours
**ROI**: Poor (may break functionality)

## Problem Statement
Current status: 6 vulnerabilities (1 low, 3 moderate, 2 high) after @lhci/cli removal. Force audit fix would downgrade @vercel/node to 2.3.0 causing major regression.

## Current State
- **Vulnerabilities**: 6 total (1 low, 3 moderate, 2 high)
- **Location**: All remaining vulnerabilities are in development dependencies
- **Risk**: Force audit fix would downgrade @vercel/node to 2.3.0 (major regression)
- **Impact**: No production runtime exposure from current vulnerabilities

## Proposed Solution
Create comprehensive strategy for addressing vulnerabilities without breaking functionality:
- Document security risk assessment for production vs development vulnerabilities
- Create safe dependency update plan with testing protocols
- Establish monitoring for upstream security patches
- Define criteria for when to pursue breaking dependency updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document security risk assessment for production vs development vulnerabilities
- [ ] Create safe dependency update plan with rollback procedures
- [ ] Establish monitoring for upstream security patches
- [ ] Define criteria for when to pursue breaking dependency updates
- [ ] Test current functionality remains intact
- [ ] Create vulnerability triage process documentation

## Effort Estimate
2-4 hours (single sprint effort)

## Priority Justification
Medium priority - all vulnerabilities are in development dependencies with no production runtime exposure.

## ROI Assessment
Poor - May break functionality while providing minimal security benefit for development-only vulnerabilities
