# Dependencies: Establish automated dependency security monitoring

**Labels**: `type: story`, `backend`, `enhancement`
**Project**: NearestNiceWeather App Development
**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**ROI**: Good (ongoing security awareness)

## Problem Statement
Current Dependabot setup needs improvement with security-focused dependency monitoring and alerts for high/critical vulnerabilities in production dependencies.

## Current State
- **Dependabot**: Basic setup exists but needs enhancement
- **Monitoring**: Limited visibility into security vulnerabilities
- **Alerts**: No differentiation between production and development dependency vulnerabilities
- **Response**: No escalation procedures for critical security issues

## Proposed Solution
Enhance dependency security monitoring with focus on production dependencies:
- Configure GitHub security alerts for production dependencies only
- Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Create escalation procedures for critical security vulnerabilities
- Document triage process for security vs development dependency issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Configure GitHub security alerts for production dependencies only
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create escalation procedures for critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document security vs development dependency triage process
- [ ] Test alert notifications work correctly
- [ ] Create runbook for security vulnerability response

## Effort Estimate
2-3 hours (process improvement effort)

## Priority Justification
Low priority - process improvement that provides ongoing security awareness and better vulnerability management.

## ROI Assessment
Good - Low effort with ongoing security awareness benefit and improved vulnerability response capabilities
