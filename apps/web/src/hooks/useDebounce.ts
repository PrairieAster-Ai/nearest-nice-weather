/**
 * PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION HOOK - DEBOUNCED VALUES
 *
 * PURPOSE: Prevents excessive API calls during rapid user interactions
 * - Delays execution of expensive operations (like API calls) until user stops interacting
 * - Critical for <100ms dopamine hit user experience with weather filters
 * - Prevents API rate limiting and reduces server load
 *
 * USAGE: Weather filter changes debounced to 150ms for optimal balance:
 * - Fast enough for instant gratification feeling
 * - Slow enough to prevent API spam during rapid filter changes
 * - Allows "instant" UI feedback while debouncing actual data fetching
 *
 * BUSINESS CONTEXT: Core to "biological UX optimization" mentioned in business plan
 * - Users get instant visual feedback from UI state changes
 * - Backend calls optimized to prevent performance degradation
 * - Supports both desktop and mobile touch interactions
