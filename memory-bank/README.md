# Memory Bank Business Context

This directory contains structured business context for Claude Code pair programming sessions.

## Directory Structure

- **business-context/**: Core business model and requirements
- **technical-patterns/**: Successful patterns and anti-patterns
- **troubleshooting/**: Common issues and proven solutions
- **session-handoffs/**: Templates for session continuity
- **qa-automation/**: QA patterns and test requirements
- **performance-data/**: Performance baselines and trends

## Quick Reference

**Business Model**: B2C outdoor recreation platform for Minnesota
**Primary Data**: poi_locations table (parks, trails, outdoor destinations)
**Tech Stack**: Vercel + Neon PostgreSQL + React PWA
**User Journey**: POI discovery with auto-expanding search radius

## Critical Commands

```bash
# Environment health check
./scripts/comprehensive-health-check.sh localhost

# QA automation before deployment
npm run qa:deployment-gate

# Start unified development environment
npm start
```

## Red Flags (Stop and Fix Immediately)

- ❌ Cities showing instead of parks/trails
- ❌ Blank screen on any environment
- ❌ API queries using legacy "locations" table
- ❌ Manual screenshot sharing workflow
- ❌ B2B tourism features being developed

## Success Patterns

- ✅ All results from poi_locations table
- ✅ Auto-expand working for remote users
- ✅ Playwright MCP for automated testing
- ✅ Comprehensive health checks before coding
- ✅ Business model validation in all tests
