  "target_threshold": ">= 90%",
  "action_required_threshold": "< 70%",
  "interpretation": {
    "95-100%": "OPTIMAL - Proceed with complex development tasks",
    "85-94%": "GOOD - Safe for normal development, monitor trends",

## üö® **PRODUCTIVITY DEGRADATION PATTERNS**

### **Pattern 1: Port Conflict Cascade**
```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  - service_detection.port_3001: true AND service_detection.port_3002: true
  - OR multiple_node_processes_same_port: true
warning_signs:
  - "Connection refused" errors in development
  - Services starting but not accessible
  - Proxy configuration errors
historical_impact: "8-10 hours/week troubleshooting time"
claude_action_priority: "IMMEDIATE - Environment takes precedence over feature work"
resolution_commands:
  - "pkill -f 'node.*vite' && npm run dev"
  - "./dev-startup.sh"
  - "Check vite.config.ts proxy configuration"
```

### **Pattern 2: Service Startup Race Conditions** 
```yaml

  - cpu_usage > 85% AND process_count.node > 3
  - OR frontend_available: true AND api_available: false
  - OR database_connection_attempts > 5 AND success_rate < 50%
warning_signs:

```

### **Pattern 3: Docker Networking Breakdown**
```yaml

  - system.uptime < 3600 AND docker.containers.running: true AND localhost.unreachable: true
  - OR ports.bound.includes(5432) AND database.reachable: false
warning_signs:
  - System restart occurred
  - Services bound to ports but unreachable
  - Docker containers running but localhost fails
historical_impact: "2-4 hours/week Docker troubleshooting"
claude_action_priority: "MEDIUM - Known issue with specific fix"
resolution_commands:
  - "sudo systemctl restart docker"
  - "docker restart weather-postgres"
  - "./dev-startup.sh"
```

### **Pattern 4: Configuration Drift**
```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  - environment_variables.VITE_API_PROXY_URL != "http://localhost:4000"
  - OR .env.modified: true AND services.failing: true
  - OR proxy_404_rate > 10%
warning_signs:
  - API calls routing to wrong endpoints
  - Environment variables inconsistent
  - Recent configuration file changes
historical_impact: "2-3 hours/week configuration debugging"
claude_action_priority: "MEDIUM - Validate before feature work"
resolution_commands:
  - "Compare .env with .env.example"
  - "Verify vite.config.ts proxy settings"
  - "Check API endpoint consistency"
```

## üß† **CLAUDE AI DECISION FRAMEWORK**

### **Task Prioritization Based on Environment Health**

#### **Health Score 95-100% (OPTIMAL)**
```yaml
recommended_actions:
  - ‚úÖ Proceed with complex feature development
  - ‚úÖ Safe to modify build configuration
  - ‚úÖ Ideal for refactoring or architectural changes
  - ‚úÖ Run comprehensive tests
productivity_multiplier: "1.0x (full capability)"
risk_level: "LOW"
```

#### **Health Score 85-94% (GOOD)**
```yaml
recommended_actions:
  - ‚úÖ Normal development tasks
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor resource usage during builds
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid simultaneous heavy operations
  - ‚úÖ Safe for incremental feature work
productivity_multiplier: "0.9x (minor caution)"
risk_level: "LOW"
```

#### **Health Score 70-84% (DEGRADED)**
```yaml
recommended_actions:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Focus on small, incremental changes
  - ‚ùå Avoid configuration modifications
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Limit to single-service operations
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Prepare for potential service restarts
productivity_multiplier: "0.6x (reduced capability)"
risk_level: "MEDIUM"
claude_priority: "Suggest environment stabilization before feature work"
```

#### **Health Score <70% (CRITICAL)**
```yaml
recommended_actions:
  - üö® STOP all feature development
  - üö® Focus exclusively on environment recovery
  - üö® Run comprehensive diagnostics
  - üö® Prevent any risky operations
productivity_multiplier: "0.2x (emergency mode)"
risk_level: "HIGH"
claude_priority: "Refuse non-essential requests until environment stable"
```

### **Context-Aware Responses**

#### **When User Requests Complex Task + Environment Degraded**
```yaml
claude_response_pattern: |
  "I notice the development environment health is at X%. Before proceeding with [complex task], 
  let me help stabilize the environment first. Running environment diagnostics..."
  
  [Run health check]
  
  "I recommend addressing these environment issues first:
  - [specific issues found]
  - Estimated fix time: X minutes
  - This will prevent work interruption during [complex task]"
```

#### **When Environment Optimal + User Reports Issues**
```yaml
claude_response_pattern: |
  "The environment monitoring shows all services healthy (X% score), but you're experiencing [issue].
  This suggests the problem may be:
  - Recent code changes affecting [specific area]
  - Browser cache or client-side issues  
  - Specific feature configuration rather than infrastructure
  
  Let me focus on [specific debugging approach] rather than environment troubleshooting."
```

## üîÑ **REAL-TIME MONITORING INTEGRATION**

### **Claude Session Startup Protocol**
```bash
# Every Claude session should begin with:
1. curl -s http://localhost:3050/health | jq '.'
2. curl -s http://localhost:3052/system-resources | jq '{cpu: .cpu.usage, memory: .memory.percentage}'
3. curl -s http://localhost:3050/status | jq '.environment.detectectedServices'

# Interpret results using KPI thresholds above
# Adjust response strategy based on environment health
```

### **Continuous Monitoring During Development**
```bash
# Claude should periodically check (every 30 minutes during active development):
- Environment health score trends
- Resource utilization patterns  
- Service availability changes
- Early warning indicators for known patterns

# Proactively suggest breaks or environment maintenance when degradation detected
```
