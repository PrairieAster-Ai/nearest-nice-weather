## ðŸŒ¸ BLOOMING CONTEXT FOR RAPID RESTART

**If Frontend Not Loading Properly:**
```bash
# Our garden needs both services blooming:
node dev-api-server.js &          # Soil (API) - port 4000
cd apps/web && npm run dev &       # Flowers (Frontend) - port 3001

# Test the garden health:
curl "http://localhost:4000/api/poi-locations-with-weather?limit=3" | jq '.data[0].name'
```

**If Database Seems Empty:**
```bash
# Re-seed our garden:
node scripts/seed-minnesota-parks.js

# Should see: "âœ¨ Total POIs in full bloom: 138 locations!"
```

**If Weather Data Missing:**
- Weather integration is working - some parks may not have nearby stations
- Look for parks like "Itasca State Park" which shows weather from "Bemidji"
- Proximity queries from Minneapolis return weather-rich results
