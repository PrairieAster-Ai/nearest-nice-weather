- **Home Base**: Minneapolis (but could be ANY metro area)
- **Willing to Drive**: 60-90 minutes for great conditions
- **Prefers Close**: 15-30 minutes for decent conditions
- **Transit Reality**: Car required, parking considerations matter

**Weather Sensitivity**:
- **Deal Breakers**: Rain >50%, wind >20mph, temp <20°F or >90°F
- **Activity Dependent**: Hiking vs biking vs photography have different weather needs

#### **Current Frustration: The "Weather Roulette" Problem**

3. **Pick Activity**: Choose hiking, drive 45 minutes to popular trail
4. **Reality**: Overcast and windy, crowded trail, mediocre experience
5. **Frustration**: Wasted 3 hours + gas for subpar outdoor time
