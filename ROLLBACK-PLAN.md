# ROLLBACK PLAN - Tech Debt Cleanup Feature Branch

**Created**: 2025-07-16 00:02 UTC  
**Branch**: `feature/tech-debt-cleanup`  
**Commit**: `0fcc04f` - feat: Complete comprehensive tech debt cleanup and CI/CD infrastructure

## Quick Rollback Options

### Option 1: Revert to Previous Working State
```bash
# If preview deployment fails, immediately revert to known working state
git checkout main
git pull origin main
npm run deploy:preview
```

### Option 2: Rollback Specific Changes
```bash
# Revert just the infrastructure changes while keeping core fixes
git revert 0fcc04f --no-commit
git reset HEAD -- apps/web/src/App.tsx  # Keep the lint/TypeScript fixes
git commit -m "Rollback infrastructure changes, keep code quality fixes"
```

### Option 3: Emergency Production Rollback
```bash
# If production is affected (unlikely, but emergency procedure)
git checkout main
npm run deploy:prod -- --confirm
```

## What Can Be Safely Rolled Back

**✅ Safe to Rollback (No User Impact)**:
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipelines (affects deployment process only)
- `scripts/` - Development and monitoring scripts
- Performance monitoring and budget scripts
- BrowserToolsMCP server enhancements
- Documentation files (*.md)
- Vercel preview authentication system

**⚠️ Consider Impact Before Rollback**:
- `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - Contains lint and TypeScript fixes for production
- `apps/web/api/auth-bypass.js` - New API endpoint (preview only)
- Build configuration changes in `vite.config.ts`

**❌ Do Not Rollback**:
- Code quality fixes (lint errors, TypeScript errors)
- Health endpoint improvements
- Essential bug fixes

## Monitoring After Deployment

### Immediate Checks (First 5 minutes)
```bash
# Verify preview deployment health
curl -s https://preview-url.vercel.app/health.json | jq '.'

# Check build status
gh run list --limit 3

# Verify BrowserToolsMCP can capture screenshot
npm run preview:screenshot https://preview-url.vercel.app
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring
```bash
# Watch GitHub Actions
gh run watch

# Check Lighthouse CI results
gh pr checks --watch

# Monitor performance budgets
npm run performance:lighthouse
```

### Rollback Triggers

**Immediate Rollback If**:
- Preview deployment completely fails to load
- Build process fails in production
- Critical user-facing functionality broken
- Database connection issues

**Investigate Before Rollback If**:
- CI/CD pipeline warnings (may be first-run issues)
- Performance budget alerts (may be configuration)
- Authentication issues (preview environment only)

## Contact and Escalation

**First Response**: Rollback using Option 1 above
**Investigation**: Check GitHub Actions logs and Vercel deployment logs
**Documentation**: Update SESSION-HANDOFF.md with any issues encountered

## Recovery Validation

After any rollback, verify:
1. Preview environment loads correctly
2. Health endpoint responds
3. Core user functionality works
4. No console errors in browser
5. Performance metrics within acceptable range

This rollback plan ensures we can quickly recover from any deployment issues while preserving the valuable code quality improvements.
