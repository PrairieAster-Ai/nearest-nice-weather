## 3. Proposed Solution

### 3.1 Two-Track Approach

**Track 1: Code Quality Remediation** (Weeks 1-3)
- Fix CRITICAL code duplication
- Implement test coverage
- Resolve security vulnerabilities
- Establish quality baseline for expansion

**Track 2: Overpass API Integration** (Weeks 4-8)
- Build Overpass API client
- Implement data normalization pipeline
- Migrate POI database to 1,000+ locations
- Deploy with comprehensive testing

### 3.2 Overpass API Integration Strategy

#### Data Source

**OpenStreetMap via Overpass API**:
- URL: https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter
- Query Language: Overpass QL
- Output Format: JSON
- Rate Limits: 10,000 queries/day, 1GB data/day
- Cost: Free (open source)

#### Minnesota Bounding Box
```
North: 49.0Â° (Canadian border)
South: 43.5Â° (Iowa border)
West: -97.0Â° (North Dakota/South Dakota border)
East: -89.0Â° (Wisconsin border)
```

#### Target POI Categories

**Priority 1: Core Outdoor Recreation** (Week 4-5)
1. **Parks** (`leisure=park`, `leisure=nature_reserve`)
   - Estimated: 2,000+ locations
   - Quality: High (well-mapped)

2. **Trails** (`highway=path`, `highway=track`)
   - Estimated: 3,000+ trail segments
   - Quality: Varies by region

3. **Nature Centers** (`tourism=information`, `information=nature_center`)
   - Estimated: 100+ locations
   - Quality: High (institutional mapping)

**Priority 2: Water & Beach Access** (Week 6)
4. **Water Access** (`leisure=beach`, `leisure=fishing`, `leisure=slipway`)
   - Estimated: 200+ locations
   - Quality: Moderate

**Priority 3: Additional Recreation** (Week 7)
5. **Forests** (`landuse=forest`, `natural=forest`)
   - Estimated: 500+ areas
   - Quality: Varies

**Total Target**: 1,000-1,500 actionable POI locations

#### Data Quality Strategy

**Automated Quality Scoring**:
```javascript
function calculateQualityScore(osmElement) {
  let score = 0;

  // Name present (+2 points)
  if (osmElement.tags.name) score += 2;

  // Detailed tagging (+1 point each)
  if (osmElement.tags.description) score += 1;
  if (osmElement.tags.website) score += 1;
  if (osmElement.tags.opening_hours) score += 1;

  // Verified by multiple editors (+2 points)
  if (osmElement.version > 3) score += 2;

  // Recent update (+1 point)
  const daysSinceUpdate = (Date.now() - osmElement.timestamp) / 86400000;
  if (daysSinceUpdate < 365) score += 1;

  return Math.min(score, 10); // Max 10 points
}

// Import threshold: score >= 6
```

**Manual Review Process**:
- High-traffic locations (>1000 visits/year): Manual verification
- Low-quality scores (<6): Flagged for review
- Duplicate detection: Compare against existing 138 POI database
- User feedback integration: Report data quality issues

### 3.3 Technical Architecture

#### New Module Structure
```
shared/
  weather/
    filters.js                    # Extracted weather filter logic (Week 1)
    filters.test.js               # Comprehensive unit tests

```

#### API Endpoint Modifications

**No Breaking Changes**:
- Existing `/api/poi-locations-with-weather` endpoint unchanged
- Response schema remains compatible
- Frontend requires zero modifications

**Internal Improvements**:
- Replace duplicated code with `shared/weather/filters.js`
- Use `shared/database/queries.js` for distance calculations
- Implement `shared/logging/logger.js` for structured logging
- Add comprehensive test coverage

#### Database Schema Evolution

**New Fields** (additive, no breaking changes):
```sql
ALTER TABLE poi_locations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS data_source VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'manual';
ALTER TABLE poi_locations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS external_id VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE;
ALTER TABLE poi_locations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS quality_score INTEGER DEFAULT 10;
ALTER TABLE poi_locations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_verified TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
ALTER TABLE poi_locations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS osm_tags JSONB;
```

**Indexing**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_data_source ON poi_locations(data_source);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_external_id ON poi_locations(external_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_quality_score ON poi_locations(quality_score);
```

**Backward Compatibility**:
- Existing 138 POI records: `data_source='manual'`, `quality_score=10`
- No data migration required for existing records
- Frontend queries unchanged
